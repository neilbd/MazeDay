# ToTheMiddle

To The Middle is a two-player sound game designed for children with visual impairments, although anyone can play. The players
hears a series of popping sounds. Once the players hear the loudest of the popping sounds, the first player who hits
the f-key (representing Player 1) or the j-key (representing Player 2) gets a point. The game also has a visual component
for other users to play, in which two sprites move back and forth and move up the screen once the loudest popping sound is made.
